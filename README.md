# Next_Candle_Color
This project was designed to forecast the USDJPY's next candle color by using various classifier models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN.  

## Features
- Classification_Models
- Technical_Analysis
- Forecasting
- Confusion Matrix

## Usage
If you can predict the color of the next candle with an acceptable degree of accuracy then one of the simplest things you can do is set a **day-trading strategy**! For instance, when the classifier labels a new record with acceptable accuracy one might buy at the open and close his/her position at the close or vice versa. Our best classifier among other models was the Decision Tree which had **61% accuracy**. We can interpret this as a 61% Winning rate trading strategy!
